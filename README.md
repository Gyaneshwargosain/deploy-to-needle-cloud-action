### Installation

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/deploy-to-needle-cloud-action.git
   ```

3. Navigate to your project directory:

   ```bash
   cd deploy-to-needle-cloud-action
   ```

4. **Set up GitHub Actions**:
   - Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository.
   - Choose a template or create a new workflow.

## üöÄ Usage

After setting up, you can begin using the action. Add the following to your workflow YAML file:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Needle Cloud

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Deploy to Needle Cloud
        uses: Gyaneshwargosain/deploy-to-needle-cloud-action@v1
        with:
          needle-token: ${{ secrets.NEEDLE_TOKEN }}
```

Make sure to replace `NEEDLE_TOKEN` with your actual Needle Cloud token.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can customize the deployment process through various options:

- `needle-token`: Required. Your Needle Cloud token for authentication.
- `project-id`: Optional. Specify the project ID for targeted deployment.
